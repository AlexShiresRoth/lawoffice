A living trust is a legal construct that gives you access to your money while you live, but then transfers that money directly into a trust for your beneficiaries to use. Rothenberg Law Office, PLLC understands that the probate period can pose serious issues for your heirs if they do not have the money to pay for things like the utility bills of their newly acquired property. Call us today for help finding a workaround to this problem through a living trust.</p>
